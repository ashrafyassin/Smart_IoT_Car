# IOT_Project

We built a smart IoT Car that users can control remotely from a phone and can view its live video stream. The car microcontroller is a Raspberry Pi (RPi) which controls the car motors, servos, and camera. The user controls the car using an android App we developed in Java. The App sends the user commands to the RPi via AWS, and the App also shows a live video stream from the remote carâ€™s camera using p2p connection to minimize the stream delay.
